              <b>Sensewalking Flux</b> is a participatory research project based on multisensory navigation that explores embodied experiences in understanding the city. This work invites participants to engage in <b>sensewalking</b>, where sensory interations—sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste—are documented using specific recording patterns and then translated into a <b>generative score</b>. This score is later presented as a <b>collective performance</b>, transforming data into sound that reflects a cross-sensory experience of Braga: a landmark as it is and as it is perceived.

<b>This project unfolds in three phases:</b> <br><br>
				
<b>// Sensewalking & Mapping</b> – Participants explore Braga through embodied perception, documenting their experiences through sketches, sound patterns, textures, and bodily sensations. These observations are converted into a graphic score, capturing an intersubjective experience of the city. <br><br>
				
<b>// DIY Bio-Synth Workshop</b> – Participants assemble a light-sensitive synthesizer, establishing a connection between visual stimuli and sound. <br><br>
				
<B>// Collective Audio-Visual Performance</B> – The generated score serves as a guide for an improvised performance in public space, merging movement, sound, and visual projections into an intersubjective ecology between body, space, and technology <br><br>
				
This project highlights <b>spontaneity, perception, and intersubjectivity</b>, fostering an egalitarian interaction between the city and its inhabitants. By positioning the city as a "<b>living instrument</b>," Sensewalking Flux celebrates the unpredictability that emerges from the ecotone between body, space, and technology.

            <h2 id="Seeing">Seeing Beyond Sight: A Sketching Exercise</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
Sketching is more than just drawing what’s in front of you—it’s a way of learning to see. It trains us to observe details, patterns, and relationships between spaces, objects, and people. Sketching helps us analyze our surroundings, making us more aware of the invisible forces shaping them. <br><br>

As Norman Crowe and Paul Laseau put it,<br>
<i>"Seeing is a necessary prelude to visual expression.”</i> <br><br>

Eric Jenkins expands on this, explaining that sketching is a bodily interaction:<br>
<i>"It is necessary to learn from the world by engaging in its reality—its materials, its columns, its smells, its temperature.”</i> <br><br>

But here’s the twist: sketching isn’t just about what’s in front of us.
It’s also about what we feel, remember, and imagine. There are two
ways of sketching:<br>
<b>1. Referential Sketching</b> – recording exactly what you see.<br>
<b>2. Analytical Sketching</b> – capturing movement, patterns,
 and sensations beyond the visual.

Every step tells a story. Movements—whether human, animal, or even mechanical—shape the rhythm of a place. Let’s capture these unseen patterns through sketching. <br><br>
				  
<b>Try this:</b> <br>		  
// Find a space where people (or creatures) are moving—maybe a busy street, a park, or a café.<br>
// Observe the movement. Where do people walk? Where do the pause?<br>
// Now, sketch the movement—not the people themselves, but the pathways they create.<br>
// Can you show the difference between a steady walk, a hesitant pause, or a sudden sprint? <br>
// What would movement sound like if it were a shape?

<i>"Architecture shapes sound, and sound shapes architecture."</i> <br>

Sound surrounds us in ways sight cannot. Close your eyes in a crowded café, a marketplace, or a quiet alley. The city hums, murmurs, clicks, and echoes. It reverberates against buildings, dissolves into the wind, or lingers in forgotten corners.<br>

<b>Try this:</b> <br>
// Choose a spot to sit or stand. Close your eyes. Just listen.<br>

// What’s the loudest sound? The quietest?<br>

            <p class="text">
Smell is the most <i>unnoticed</i> but <i>memorable</i> sense. A single scent can transport you back in time—a childhood home, a street market in another city, the salty breeze of a distant beach.<br><br>

Pallasmaa calls this the <i>“space of smell”</i>, where scent engraves itself into our perception of place. In urban design, scent can reveal the history and character of a space, influencing how we navigate it.<br>

// Take a slow walk and focus only on smell. What do you notice? <br>
// Are the smells pleasant or unpleasant? Do they remind you of something? <br>
// Where do certain scents appear and disappear? <br>
// How does smell shape your experience of a place? <br><br>

<b>Pro tip:</b> <br>
Try mapping your journey using only smells. Imagine drawing the city with scent trails instead of streets.

<i>"Touch is the mother of all senses."</i> <br>

Touch is how we first experience the world. Before we see clearly, we <i>feel</i>. Spaces aren’t just visual compositions—they have textures, temperatures, and sensations that define how we experience them. <br><br>
Buildings aren’t just shapes; they’re warm, cool, rough, smooth, grainy, or metallic. Our skin sees just as much as our eyes.

Sensewalking Flux isn’t about <i>finding</i> something specific—it’s about <i>noticing</i> what’s already there. 
Every sense tells a different story of the city, and together, they create an experience that goes beyond just looking. <br><br>

<b>Some final prompts to reflect on: </b> <br>
// Did you notice something today that you had never paid attention to before? <br>
// How did different senses shape your perception of a place? <br>
// Did mapping movement, sound, smell, or texture change how you understand the city? <br>
// If you could create a map that isn’t based on streets, what would you include? <br><br>

Sensewalking is a way of tuning in—to the city, to others, and to yourself. Keep sensing, keep walking, and keep rediscovering the world around you. <br><br>

<b>Let’s Make the City Sing!</b> <br>
Before we dive into the partiture of Braga, we need a way to translate the unseen—light, movement, and energy—into something we can hear. That’s where DIY Bio-Synths come in! <br><br>

<b>What’s a Bio-Synth?</b> <br>
Think of it as a tiny electronic creature that listens to the world in ways we can’t. Instead of using a microphone, it captures <b>light intensity</b> and turns it into <b>sound</b>. The brighter the light, the louder or higher the pitch—kind of like the city humming its own tune! <br><br>

<b>What We’ll Do</b> <br>
// <b>Assemble Your Synth</b> – We’ll guide you through building a simple bio-synth using sensors, circuits, and a bit of magic. <br>
// <b>Experiment with Light & Sound</b> – Wave your hands, block the light, or let the sunset play its own melody. <br>
// <b>Prepare for Collective Composition</b> – The bio-synths will later be used in Phase 3, where we’ll translate the sensewalking partiture into a live sound performance. <br><br>

<b>Why This Matters?</b> <br>
This isn’t just about making cool noises (though that’s a bonus). It’s about <b>expanding perception</b>, listening to the environment beyond human senses, and finding new ways to interact with urban space. <br><br>

<b>Ready to tune in? Let’s build, explore, and make the city sing!</b>

            <p class="text">
<b>Welcome to the Flux! </b> <br><br>

This is not your usual performance. No set melodies, no fixed rhythms—just you, your hands, and the light-sensitive soundscape we create together. Imagine mapping a city through sound, translating movement into frequencies, and letting light shape our sonic world. Ready to dive in? <br><br>

<b>How It Works</b> <br>
Each performer holds a <b>transparent acetate sheet</b> with <b>black marker patterns</b>—this is your score. By moving your hands along the drawn paths, you control how much light passes through. These light variations are picked up by <b>DIY synthesizers</b>, which respond through potentiometers or variable resistors, translating gestures into sound. <br><br>

// <b>More light = Higher frequencies or increased modulation.</b> <br>
// <b>Less light = Lower frequencies or subdued sound.</b> <br><br>

Meanwhile, the environment is part of the composition. Shadows, external light sources, and movement introduce unexpected shifts. Our <b>live digital processors</b>—one on <b>sound mixing & FX</b>, the other on <b>visuals & LED mapping</b>—shape this real-time dialogue, amplifying the city’s hidden textures into an immersive performance.
